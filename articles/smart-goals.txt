- SMART goals are `specific`, `measurable`, `actionable`, `relevant`, and `time-bound`. The acronym SMART stands for `Specific`, `Measurable`, `Achievable`, `Relevant`, and `Time-bound`. SMART goals are a framework for setting clear, achievable objectives that help guide decision-making and action
- SMART goals should be `specific` enough to guide `actionable` steps, `measurable` to track progress, `achievable` to build confidence, `relevant` to align with `long-term vision`, and `time-bound` to create a sense of urgency. SMART goals help ensure that objectives are clear, achievable, and aligned with the organization's overall strategy
- SMART goals are a framework for setting clear, achievable objectives that help guide decision-making and action. SMART goals are a tool for setting `clear objectives` that help guide decision-making and action, ensuring that objectives are `clear`, `achievable`, and aligned with the organization's overall strategy
- SMART is a `mnemonic` used as a `device` to establish criteria for effective `goal-setting` and `objective development`, commonly applied in `project management`, `employee performance management`, and `personal development`
- SMART criteria: `Specific`, `Measurable`, `Assignable`, `Realistic`, `Time-bound` objectives, first proposed by `George T. Doran` in the November 1981 issue of 'Management Review', [1] to set objectives that are Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time-bound—hence the acronym S.M.A.R.T
- Proponents of SMART objectives argue that these criteria facilitate a clear framework for `goal setting` and `evaluation`, applicable across various contexts such as `business` (between employee and employer) and `sports` (between athlete and coach), enabling the individual setting the goal to have a `precise understanding` of the expected outcomes, while the evaluator has `concrete criteria` for assessment
- The SMART acronym is linked to `Peter Drucker`'s `Management by Objectives` (MBO) concept, illustrating its foundational role in `strategic planning` and `performance management` [4]
- Since its inception, the SMART framework has evolved, leading to the emergence of different variations of the acronym, commonly used versions incorporating alternative words, including '`attainable`', '`relevant`', and '`timely`', while several authors have introduced supplementary letters to the acronym, such as '`self-defined`' for SMARTS goals or '`timely`' for SMARTER goals [2][3]
- The term SMART was first proposed by `George T. Doran` in the November 1981 issue of 'Management Review', [1] where he advocated for setting objectives that are Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time-bound—hence the acronym S.M.A.R.T
- SMART goals are `specific`, `measurable`, `achievable`, `relevant`, and `time-bound` criteria to improve goal success, introduced by consultant `George T. Doran` in a 1981 paper called "`There's a SMART Way to Write Management's Goals and Objectives`"
- When setting SMART goals, consider `who` needs to be involved, `what` you want to accomplish, `when` the goal should be achieved, `where` the goal applies, `which` obstacles or requirements, and `why` the goal is important
- Make SMART goals `tangible` by setting `milestones` and `metrics` to measure progress, such as specific tasks to accomplish for a project that will take a few months to complete
- Focus on making SMART goals `attainable` by thinking about how to accomplish them and if you have the necessary `tools` and `skills`. If you don't currently possess those tools/skills, consider what it would take to attain them
- Ensure SMART goals are `aligned` with broader business objectives. For example, if the goal is to launch a new product, it should be something that's in alignment with the overall business objectives
- Provide a `target date` for deliverables and define what should be achieved `halfway through` the process to create a sense of urgency and ensure realistic timing

- SMART goals are `specific`, `measurable`, `achievable`, `realistic`, and `time-bound` objectives that set clear, easy-to-communicate `milestones` and `metrics` to create concrete steps towards larger strategies
- Specific SMART goals answer questions like `concrete steps`, `necessary people`, `effort locations`, `long-term strategy value`, and `goal priority` to form a clear path from start to finish
- Measurable SMART goals quantify progress, let everyone evaluate performance, and provide `data reliability` and `verifiable milestones` to track progress towards the goal
- Achievable SMART goals are within realistic capabilities, allow for `sustainable progress`, and consider `internal and external limits` to motivate achievement and real progress
- Realistic SMART goals are relevant to current business needs, adjust criteria as time passes, and identify when `business needs change` to stay on track

- SMART goals work well on the `personal level` for individual or small team performance tracking, directly impacting the organization's performance on a larger scale
- SMART has two distinct flaws: it breaks down a larger strategy into achievable parts, but if the overall strategy is poor, SMART will only help achieve poor strategy goals; it is a method of setting goals, not analyzing successes and failures
- Evaluate SMART goals by thinking about `pitfalls`, `questions asked`, `people involved`, and so on to reflect on methods and set better goals
- SMART goals are a tool to create criteria to improve the chances of succeeding in accomplishing a goal, introduced by consultant `George T. Doran` in a 1981 paper called `"There's a SMART Way to Write Management's Goals and Objectives."`
- SMART goals acronym stands for `Specific`, `Measurable`, `Achievable`, `Relevant`, and `Time-bound`. Each letter has a specific meaning to help set effective goals

- SMART goals are specific (`I will walk 10 minutes today`), `measurable` (10 minutes), `achievable` (take small chunks), `relevant` (aligned with your values and important to you), and `timely` (set a deadline). Writing them down increases motivation and achievement by `9 times`, according to research
