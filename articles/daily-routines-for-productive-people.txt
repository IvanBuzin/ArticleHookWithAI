- Starting work immediately, without waiting for perfect conditions, is the `single greatest productivity hack` for increasing `output per unit of time`, according to Alex Hormozi. Confronting work head-on is more effective than romanticizing extensive morning routines and supplement rituals
- The `zygonic effect`, a study on servers recalling orders, demonstrates that the brain abhors `open loops` and prefers `closure`. Finishing a task, even halfway through a sentence, reduces `activation energy` to begin the next day and keeps it in mind overnight

- Develop a `sense of urgency` and take action fast. Two percent of the population have this quality, according to the `Gallup Organization`. They take things and run with them like a ball player catching a fumble and running for the goal line
- Listen to your `intuition`, which is one of the best guides you possibly have. It will always give you the exact right answer for you. Every single time you have a problem or difficulty, high performing men and women sit back, dissect it, and learn everything possible from it
- Take courses in `communications`, `listening`, and `public speaking` to develop the people skills you need to be successful. The size of your `vocabulary` will have a tremendous impact on your life

- Identify your `most important tasks` (MITs) and do them `first thing in the morning`, when you're at your `cognitive best` for about `2 hours`, according to behavioral psychologist `Dan Ariely`
- Work from a `calendar` instead of a `to-do list`. `41%` of to-do list items are never done, while a calendar helps prioritize and schedule time for tasks
- Beat procrastination by `preparing for future excuses` and putting obstacles in your path, like setting an alarm across the room to force yourself to get up and start your workout
- Control your `inbox` by shutting off notifications and processing email `three times a day` (morning, noon, night) to avoid distraction and stay focused on important tasks
- Schedule meetings as a `last resort`. Say no to meetings before `noon` to protect deep work time, and limit meetings to `5-10 minutes` at most, according to `Richard Branson`
- Focus on your `unique strengths and passion`, and delegate tasks to others even if they're not perfect. Letting go of tasks allows you to `freed up time` to focus on high-impact activities

- Prioritize tasks based on their `urgency and importance`. Focus on the most critical tasks first, and break them down into smaller, manageable steps
- Limit your schedule to only `high-priority activities` that align with your `values and goals`. Fill your calendar with tasks that support your immediate objectives, and say no to everything else
- `Habits` are automatic behaviors triggered by a `cue`, while `routines` require conscious effort to maintain, according to psychology. Habits like brushing teeth after meals are `unconscious`, while routines like going for a run every day require `deliberate effort`
- Developing established routines and healthy habits is the most logical way to remain consistent in reaching goals, as shown by studies. Habits increase `quality of life`, give room for `creativity and innovation`, and make time-consuming tasks automatic, freeing the mind for creative thinking

- The vital element of Jack Dorsey's daily schedule is `day theming`, concentrating on one area of work instead of balancing dozens of tasks every day, which allowed him to maintain focus and give undivided attention to both companies equally
- By waking up without an alarm clock, Oprah maintains healthy sleeping habits and prepares her body for a successful day even before getting up, as waiting for the body to gradually enter the stage of light sleep wakes you naturally feeling refreshed and energized
- Elon Musk wakes up at `7am` after `6 hours sleep`, takes a shower, never skips coffee, and works in `5-minute blocks` to maintain high `productivity levels` and control his time
